//! The [git2version](https://crates.io/crates/git2version) crate provides a way to get the version of the package from git and incorporate it as a constant into your program.
//!
//!
//! ## Setup
//!
//! To use this, you need to setup a proxy-crate in your workspace.
//!
//! 1. Add this to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [workspace]
//!
//! [dependencies]
//! version_proxy = {path = "./version_proxy"}
//! ```
//!
//! 2. Add these files to make up the proxy crate:
//!
//! #### version_proxy/Cargo.toml:
//! ```toml
//! [package]
//! name = "version_proxy"
//! # The version field here is ignored, no need to change it
//! version = "0.0.0"
//!
//! [dependencies]
//! git2version = "*"
//!
//! [build-dependencies]
//! git2version = "*"
//! ```
//! You can also lock the version of git2version to a specific version instead of using `*`.
//!
//! #### version_proxy/build.rs:
//! ```ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     git2version::init_proxy_build!();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### version_proxy/src/lib.rs:
//! ```ignore
//! git2version::init_proxy_lib!();
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The `init_proxy_lib!` macro in your proxy crate will generate something similar to the following:
//! ```rust
//! # use git2version::{GitInfo, TagInfo};
//! pub const GITINFO: Option<GitInfo> =
//!     Some(GitInfo {
//!       tag_info: Some(TagInfo {
//!         tag:"v1.2.3-alpha",
//!         commits_since_tag: 5,
//!       }),
//!       commit_id: "a9ebd080a7",
//!       modified: false,
//!     });
//! ```
//! This object can be `None` if the crate is not in a git repository or if there was an error looking up the version information from git.
//!
//! You can use this const from your main crate, for example like this:
//! ```ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     println!("Version from git: {:?}", version_proxy::GITINFO);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ## Alternatives
//!
//! The [git-version](https://crates.io/crates/git-version) crate provides similar functionality.
//!
//! The main advantage of `git-version` over `git2version` is that it is much simpler to use. It uses a proc-macro based approach and doesn't require you to set up a proxy crate.
//!
//! The advantages of `git2version` over `git-version` are as follows:
//! * `git2version` uses the [git2](https://crates.io/crates/git2) crate to read git information. This means it works without requiring a `git` executable in your path.
//! * `git2version` outputs structured information about the git version, while `git-version` only outputs a string as produced by `git describe`.
//!   In `git-version`, you have to parse that string yourself and it might not always contain all the information (e.g. `git describe --tags` doesn't output the commit id when you have the
//!   tag itself checked out). `git2version` always gives you the commit id.
//!
//! Another point of note is that both crates use a different mechanism for change detection for incremental builds.
//! * `git2version` uses the `cargo:rerun-if-changed` mechanism of `build.rs` to re-generate the version number whenever the git repository changes (e.g. new tags being added, `git fetch` being called, ...)
//!   and whenever files in the working copy change. The latter is important because it could cause a change to the `-modified` flag of the reported version.
//! * `git-version` uses an `include_bytes!` mechanism to include bytes from your git repository data into the generated source code, which will cause cargo to detect it as a dependency and rerun the proc macro
//!   when the git repository data changes. This sounds hacky but might work. I have not tested how reliable or scalable that approach is.
//! `cargo:rerun-if-changed` is the officially supported way to do this kind of change detection, so I would expect it to be more reliable, but it only works for `build.rs` scripts, not for proc macros.
//!
//!
//! ## Why is the proxy crate required?
//!
//! The crate needs to know the directory of your git repository to read version information.
//! However, the `git2version` crate gets compiled independently from that and doesn't have access to your git repository.
//! This is why we need a proxy crate inside of your git repository that knows its location and can evaluate the version information.
//!
//! You may ask why we do it in a proxy crate instead of just having your main crate evaluate the version information, after all
//! your main crate is also in your repository. The reason is that the `build.rs` code used to evaluate the version information
//! needs to run **after every single file modification** because that could influence the `modified` tag of the git version information.
//! If we put this into your main crate, then incremental compilations become basically useless because it needs to re-compile everything
//! for every change. By putting it into a proxy crate, we only need to re-compile the code in the proxy crate and link your main crate
//! against it.
